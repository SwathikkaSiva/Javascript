I lived with that woman upstairs four years, and before that time she had tried me indeed: her character ripened and developed with frightful rapidity; her vices sprang up fast and rank: they were so strong, only cruelty could check them, and I would not use cruelty.  What a pigmy intellect she had, and what giant propensities!  How fearful were the curses those propensities entailed on me!  Bertha Mason, the true daughter of an infamous mother, dragged me through all the hideous and degrading agonies which must attend a man bound to a wife at once intemperate and unchaste.", 
                             "It could not have been ten seconds, and yet it seemed a long time that their hands were clasped together.  He had time to learn every detail of her hand.  He explored the long fingers, the shapely nails, the work-hardened palm with its row of callouses, the smooth flesh under the wrist.  Merely from feeling it he would have known it by sight.  In the same instant it occurred to him that he did not know what colour the girl's eyes were.  They were probably brown, but people with dark hair sometimes had blue eyes.  To turn his head and look at her would have been inconceivable folly.  With hands locked together, invisible among the press of bodies, they stared steadily in front of them, and instead of the eyes of the girl, the eyes of the aged prisoner gazed mournfully at Winston out of nests of hair.",
                             "But I did not know how to make my apology. The words that had strung themselves so easily to make a blunder in the drawing room would not come now that I wished the blunder remedied.  I stood there below her window, tongue-tied and ashamed.  Suddenly I saw her turn and stretch behind her, and then she leant forward once again and threw something at me from the window.  It struck me on the cheek and fell to the ground.  I stooped to pick it up.  It was one of the flowers from her bowl, an autumn crocus."];
